This repository provides R scripts for benchmarking ambient RNA contamination removal tools in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data using the 10x Genomics PBMC4k dataset. Three major workflows are included:

DecontX OR scCDC.R 
This script evaluates the performance of DecontX and scCDC using pre-cluster labels generated by DoubletFinder. The Seurat workflow is used for data preprocessing and downstream clustering/visualization.

DecontX+scCDC.R
This script runs DecontX in its default mode, and subsequently applies scCDC using pre-clusters based on DecontX results. This allows assessment of the impact of pre-clustering strategy on decontamination outcomes.

CellBender_down.R
This script demonstrates removal of ambient RNA using CellBender. The corrected matrix is loaded into Seurat for standard preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and visualization.

Requirements

R (version ≥4.x)
Seurat (version ≥4.x)
DoubletFinder
celda
scCDC
CellBender (for generating CellBender outputs)
